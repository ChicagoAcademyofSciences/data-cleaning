The lining of such it might be called was of numerous dried catkins of the oak. This is characteristic of the cukoos nest,Francis S. Dayton,,,,,The cuckoo are breeding in considerable numbers in the vicinity and especially in the open brush thickets.  We found as many as eight nests most of them with 2 eggs 2 of them with 4.  All are alike in composition but differ inside.  Our nest was so small that one egg in it filled it.  Two might possible have been croweded into it but no more.  It is surprising how a clumsy bird like a cuckoo can incubate in small of the nests so lightly are they put together.  The birds sit close and when you almost touch them flutter down into the thicket and disappear.  They are then silent later they may utter their peculiar cry.

Away I found a screech owl asleep in a deserted flickers nest which has been used the past two winters by owls.  I think this was probably one of this pair.  The bird was not in the nest and yet the eggs were warm as though they had been but recently sat upon.  They were all alike in incubation.  These owls are quite common about this prairie attracted to it by the abundance of mice it supports.  They breed in the 8 oaks that cap the ridges on either side of it.  It is a first set and rather early.  The eggs were incubated all alike.,accepted place of collection

These birds now have their first sets of eggs and building as they do in just such thickets as I have described make the finding of their first sets far more difficult than the second since then they build in bushes. The males are tireless singers and for the purpose mount some neighboring limb and pours forth its unceasing song to the female below.
