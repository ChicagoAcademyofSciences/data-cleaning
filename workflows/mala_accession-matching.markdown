# Accession Matching (malacology)
## For cleaning and cross-referencing inventory data between Arctos, inventory data, and cleaned catalog data

The goal of this project is to identify inventoried specimens with existing accession numbers. The inventory data used in this project has not yet been cleaned or cross-referenced with the catalog data. In order to efficiently and accurately identify the largest number of inventoried specimens, you will first have to clean various data fields.
