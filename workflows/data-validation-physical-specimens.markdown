# Validating Entomology Inventory Data

*Instructions written and followed by our NSF entomology transcription intern.*

Prior to 2016, CHAS non-Lepidopteran specimens were mixed up together and not physically arranged by taxonomy. This made verifying data and facilitating research use very difficult. As part of the data verification process for this InvertEBase PEN grant, and in conjunction with ongoing volunteer work, the intern also physically re-organized entomology specimens. The steps described here are slightly different for Coleoptera, as this order is being physically reorganized post-migration into Arctos.

Work was done by insect order, and completed by the follow people:

- **Blattodea** (n=27) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)

> **Coleoptera** (n=17566), IN PROGRESS - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by this NSF InvertEBase PEN grant)

- **Dermaptera** (n=6) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Diptera** (n=3054) - *Micah Saugen* and *Sam Urben* (as interns sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Ephemeroptera** (n=5) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Hemiptera** (n=1156) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University) & *Michelle Hauer* (as a volunteer)
- **Hymenoptera** (n=1311) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by this NSF InvertEBase PEN grant)
- **Isoptera** (n=4) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Mantodea** (n=14) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Mecoptera** (n=15) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Megaloptera** (n=5) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Neuroptera** (n=25) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Odonata** (n=146) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Orthoptera** (n=394) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Phasmatodea** (n=12) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Plecoptera** (n=16) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Raphidoptera** (n=2) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Trichoptera** (n=28) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)

**Non-insect arthropods** (n=767) are also part of the CHAS entomology collection, and the validation process described here was conducted for these specimens by [@ekrimmel](https://github.com/ekrimmel).

## Physically aggregating specimens

1.	Use the appropriate inventory spreadsheet (e.g. *Hymenoptera_[date].xlsx*) to find specimen storage locations. Create a list of all needed Cornell drawers and how many specimens there are in each drawer.

1.	Give each drawer its own background cell color in the spreadsheet to make finding specimens in the data easier.

1.	Bring down one drawer at a time to the entomology work station and start to find and physically group specimens by taxonomy.

## Verifying specimen inventory data

1.	Make sure the data in the inventory spreadsheet correspond with the data on each specimen’s label.

1.	Briefly note the condition of the specimen in the spreadsheet.

1.	Check to see if the listed taxonomic information is correct and still current, if not, update it.

1.  Keep track of specimen rows that have been physically verified.

1.	Once each physical specimen in the drawer has been verified, check the spreadsheet to make sure there are no digital records for specimens that weren’t found in the drawer.

1.	If specimens were found in the drawer that weren’t listed in the inventory data as being in that drawer, search the entire spreadsheet for these specimens. If they are found elsewhere in the inventory data, update their storage location to correspond with the current drawer. If they are not found in the spreadsheet, create a new entry, transcribing all pertinent data from the specimen's label/s.

1.	If specimens listed in the inventory data as being stored in the current drawer were not found, flag the row in the spreadsheet so the specimens can be searched for in other drawers. If the missing specimens aren't found in any drawer, note that they are missing in the spreadsheet.

## Labeling specimens

1.	Once the inventory data is all correct and verified, create a specimen label.

1.  Print and attach specimen labels by drawer.

## Physically reorganizing specimens by taxonomic group

1.	Once all specimens are labeled and accounted for, organize them by family, grouping the most related specimens with each other. Some of this physical reorganization can be done as new labels are applied to minimize specimen handling.

1.  Ensure that specimens are spaced apart sufficiently, and that each drawer has space for growth in the collection.

1.	Create family labels for each unit tray, and order labels for each drawer.

1.	Once specimens are in their new storage locations, update this information in the inventory data spreadsheet.


# Validating Malacology Inventory Data

**What follows is the workflow of the Malacology Verification procedure written and implemented by [@dipiquard](https://github.com/dpiquard) in Spring-Fall of 2018 for the InvertEBase NSF Grant:**

1.	Print out (from Arctos) a list of all specimens for a given cabinet organized by storage location. 
2.	Look at each, individual specimen and compare the data with the specimen to their record in Arctos. 
3.	Take note of differences in Catalog Number/Other ID numbers, Identifications, Specific locality, etc. Do research/check original catalog books to verify conflicts in data. Make appropriate changes in Arctos (add legacy IDs, fix conflicts in Verbatim/Specific Location, Date Collected, Collector information, etc.). Document any changes using appropriate remarks sections.
4.	Take note of storage quality. Does specimen need to be re-housed? Rehouse if necessary.
5.	Take note of any specimens that are in Arctos with a location, but are not found in the location given. Also, any specimens that are found in the collection (FIC) without a record in Arctos. These specimens should be added to the spreadsheet “Mala_Verification_Project_FIC_Specimens” (in Oct 2018 these were located in L:/Inventory/Malacology/DansFiles)
6.	Take note if there are any extra labels in the cabinet trays and try to match them to other specimens in the collection or to the FIC specimens.
7.	Be on the lookout for local specimens that would be good for imaging.
8.	Print labels with updated Arctos records and place label with the appropriate specimen – this part of the project has been filled by volunteer work, Paul Francuch (Cabinets 1-18), Susan Benner (Cabinet 23, 27-31), and Tim Later (Cabinets 19, 20, 21, 26 so far). Some visiting students have re-labeled Cabinets 22, 24, and 25.

## Work left to do:
1. Still yet to do: Try to match specimens in the “Mala_Verification_Project_FIC_Specimens” spreadsheet to missing specimens or to labels found in cabinet trays.
1. Once all specimens are verified and geo-referenced (at least the North American specimens), the specimens verification status can be changed to “accepted” in Arctos. Dan completed this full procedure through Cabinet 30: Tray 26 (verified up to Cab 30: Tray 26).
1. In addition, there are multiple Natural History Surveys that will need Projects created or updated in Arctos. This information, I believe to be valuable to the history of the Chicago Academy of Sciences and will provide data relevant to study of the ecosystem of the Chicago region in the early 20th century. The current “Baker Natural History Survey” Project in Arctos is full of errors and should be researched regarding removal/addition of specimens to the project. In addition, a second project should be created to account for the Natural History Survey conducted in 1908-10 during the creation and excavation of the North Shore Channel. It should be noted that none of the specimens from these Projects were georeferenced due to the nature of their collecting locality (ex: Station XXVII) and further research may be done to pinpoint exact collecting localities for these specimens [Daniel Piquard, 2018-10-02]
1. Updated labels should eventually be printed and applied to incorporate identifications per INHS malacologists in during summer 2019.
