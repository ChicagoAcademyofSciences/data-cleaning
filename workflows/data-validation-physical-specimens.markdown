# Validating Entomology Inventory Data

*Instructions written and followed by our NSF entomology transcription intern.*

Prior to 2016, CHAS non-Lepidopteran specimens were mixed up together and not physically arranged by taxonomy. This made verifying data and facilitating research use very difficult. As part of the data verification process for this InvertEBase PEN grant, and in conjunction with ongoing volunteer work, the intern also physically re-organized entomology specimens.

Work was done by insect order, and completed by the follow people:

- **Blattodea** (n=27) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)

> **Coleoptera** (n=17566), IN PROGRESS - *TBD NSF intern #3*

- **Dermaptera** (n=6) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)

> **Diptera** (n=3054), IN PROGRESS - *Micah Saugen* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)

- **Ephemeroptera** (n=5) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Hemiptera** (n=1156) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University) & *Michelle Hauer* (as a volunteer)
- **Hymenoptera** (n=1311) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by this NSF InvertEBase PEN grant)
- **Isoptera** (n=4) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Mantodea** (n=14) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Mecoptera** (n=15) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Megaloptera** (n=5) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Neuroptera** (n=25) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Odonata** (n=146) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Orthoptera** (n=394) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Phasmatodea** (n=12) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Plecoptera** (n=16) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Raphidoptera** (n=2) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)
- **Trichoptera** (n=28) - *Michael Portala* (as an intern sponsored by Loyola University)

**Non-insect arthropods** (n=767) are also part of the CHAS entomology collection, and the validation process described here was conducted for these specimens by [@ekrimmel](https://github.com/ekrimmel).

## Physically aggregating specimens

1.	Use the appropriate inventory spreadsheet (e.g. *Hymenoptera_[date].xlsx*) to find specimen locations. Create a list of all needed drawers and how many specimens there are in each drawer.

1.	Give each drawer its own background cell color in the spreadsheet to make finding specimens in the spreadsheet easier.

1.	Bring down one drawer at a time and start to find and physically group specimens by taxonomy.

## Verifying specimen inventory data

1.	Make sure the data in the spreadsheet corresponds with the data on each specimen’s label.

1.	Briefly note the condition of the specimen in the spreadsheet.

1.	Check to see if the listed taxonomic info is correct and still current, if not, update it.

1.  Keep track of specimen rows that have been physically verified.

1.	Once each physical specimen in the drawer has been verified, check the spreadsheet to make sure there are no digital entries for specimens that weren’t found in the drawer.

1.	If specimens were found in the drawer that weren’t listed in the inventory data as being in that drawer, search the entire spreadsheet for these specimens. If they are found elsewhere in the inventory data, change their storage location to correspond with the current drawer. If they are not found in the spreadsheet, create a new entry, entering all pertinent data from the specimen's labels.

1.	If specimens were listed in the inventory data as being in the current drawer but were not found, flag the row in the spreadsheet so they can be searched for in other drawers. If the missing specimens aren't found in any drawer, note that they are missing in the spreadsheet.

## Labeling specimens

1.	Once the inventory data is all correct and verified, create a specimen label.

1.  Print and attach specimen labels by drawer.

## Physically reorganizing specimens by taxonomic group

1.	Once all specimens are labeled and accounted for, organize them by family, grouping the most related specimens with each other.

1.  Ensure that specimens are spaced apart sufficiently, and that each drawer has space for growth in the collection.

1.	Create family labels for each unit tray, and order labels for each drawer.

1.	Once specimens are in their new storage locations, update this information in the inventory data spreadsheet.
