# Catalog Card Matching (malacology)

[PLACEHOLDER]

*Need to cross-reference information by catalog number / taxon. Review physical cards against inventory data, and transcribe card catalog where catalog number does not already exist in inventory data. Use to match FIC specimens.*

*Random test by EK found that most of the information on these cards is already captured in the malacology data, but some is not. Information that was present on cards and absent from digital data consisted only of sex (in the test batch). More frequently, EK found that a catalog number was present on the cards and absent in the dataâ€”could be matched to FIC specimens? Or else these would represent discarded/lost specimens.*
