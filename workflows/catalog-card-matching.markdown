# Cross-referencing Card Catalogs

CHAS has a card catalog series listing malacology (but not entomology) specimens by taxonomy. In a pre-grant review of potential ancillary materials to transcribe, these were identified because 10% of the test batch included data not found in the inventory spreadsheet. However, after integrating information from the [original catalog books](original-catalog-book-matching.markdown), we found that this is no longer true (the original catalog books contained the same information as the catalog cards). The card catalogs, therefore, are not being transcribed or cross-referenced.
