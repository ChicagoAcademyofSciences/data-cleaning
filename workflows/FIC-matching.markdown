# FIC Matching (malacology)

The goal of this process was to match found-in-collection (FIC) specimen records to their disassociated CHAS catalog numbers by cross-referencing data between inventory data, catalog records, accession records, ancillary information from archives and publications.

FIC specimens in the CHAS collections may have become physically disassociated from their catalog numbers in a variety of ways, from being on exhibit to being moved. The malacology collections were hastily moved to a new storage facility in the early 1990s, and when the collection was inventoried in 2008-2009 many specimens were jumbled together in drawers with labels loose.

## Establishing acceptable criteria for matches

At least two matching fields were required to establish a possible FIC specimen to catalog record match, and three matches were required to confirm it. The fields used to evaulate potential matches were taxon, collector, collecting locality, collecting date, and donor. Where two matches could be made and no other data conflicted, it was assumed that those two could be matched. There were cases where multiple FIC records matched a single or multiple catalog records using this criteria, and so those records were NOT matched to a specific catalog number.

## Ensuring proper formatting for spreadsheet

Our data is most easily processed when individuals and agencies are treated separately, so each got their own column. Similarly, sorting by locality is most effective when all data fields (specific locality, city, state, etc.) are standardized. Due to the number of records from the catalog books, this could not be done efficiently so sorting in this project was not as effective; nevertheless the locality sort was done to the best of the technician’s ability. A similar issue was present within the taxa, where multiple misspellings and old taxa made sorting less efficient. Sorts by taxa could still be done, but confirmation was needed throughout the process using MolluscaBase for identifying synonyms.

Some of the records in the ACCN number column were input with text, most commonly “[unconfirmed]”. Formatting the entire column as text and then using a Find and Replace to eliminate the aforementioned string allowed for a more effective sort. Be sure to save a copy of the data before completing this step so that the ACCN column can be restored at the end of the project. 

## Eliminating unmatchable and non-malacology records

Many of the records from the catalog books were not malacology records. These were marked off as “Not a malacology specimen” in the Collection Mgmt Notes column. In addition, many of the malacology records did not have enough data to be able to match at least two fields. These were marked off as “Not enough data to establish match” in the Collection Mgmt Notes column. 
By sorting the sheet by genus and species and then flagging off the records which met these two criteria, the technician was able to set aside around 66% of the original data set and complete the first overview of data matching for the FICS. All subsequent matching rounds used this smaller set of data.

## Matching

Taxa. After sorting the data by cleaned ACCN numbers and then by genus/species, the technician was able to match the majority of the project’s  matches by comparing and identifying duplicates, including within synonymized taxa. 

Donor/agency: After sorting the data by donor, and then by genus/species, the technician confirmed most of the matches in step 4 and identified a few other ones which went overlooked. This step was repeated for the the Associated with Agency column.

Locality: After sorting the data by specific locality the technician slowly worked through the data trying to find matches. The only ones found in this step were those from specific depths (e.g. 2200 ft, Foster Ave). Further searches after sorting by city or state did not yield any new results but did confirm previous matches.
