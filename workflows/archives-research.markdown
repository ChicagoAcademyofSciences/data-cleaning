# Archives Research

Many of our specimens had no available published information. However, we did have archival records associated with several individuals, e.g. Frank Collins Baker, Jose Quadras, and Elizabeth Emerson Atwater. Given the organizational state of some of the archival records, it was also deemed necessary to set up a filing system to ensure easier access.

[@samuelhowes24](https://github.com/samuelhowes24) conducted this archives research for the CHAS malacology collection.

## Staging archival materials

CHAS archives are in varying states of organization, and very few have been digitized to any degree. While the manuscript collection has been mostly processed, the institutional archives are much less so. When researching materials that were as yet unprocessed, the project technician took just enough time to sort and organize materials relevant to this grant project. These materials will be fully organized and processed at a later date.

To stage potentially-relevant materials, the project technician pulled archives related to the agent names searched during the [bibliography workflow](bibliographic-references.workflow), focusing especially on people associated with FIC specimen records.

## Identifying relevant content

As the archive materials are not digitized, it was necessary to go through them by hand. The project technician did a quick visual scan of each item, looking specifically for references to taxa, collecting localities, catalog or accession numbers, and information related to figures or publications. Relevant items were flagged with a red Post-It note on the outside of the appropriate folder.

Wherever relevant data was found, a record was made in the bibliography spreadsheet detailing the Archival Box number (where applicable) and primary author of the correspondence. Appropriate bibliography flags were then used.

Part of this was done in the bibliography workflow, where archival materials were looked through and flagged with relevant information. For the rest of this workflow, detailed notes will be used instead of flags to identify potential sources of information related to the malacology collection.

Go through archival materials listed in computer and make any notes in this sheet. Keep an eye out for specific catalog or accession numbers, plate numbers, taxa, and localities. The last step of this stage is to go through the miscellaneous correspondence in Sam’s office. This step can also involve volunteers. Use William C. Egan entry as a model. For particularly rich sources, the letter with date should be listed, with contents as a subpoint (e.g. L.E. Daniels). Any lengthy inventories of specimens (such as in Quadras Collection) should be listed as “Includes specimen inventory”.

a.	Complete named individuals first (in process), saving the largest (i.e. F.C. Baker) for last. If a person doesn’t seem to be listed anywhere, double check larger correspondence boxes like Baker Box 1 (see F.B. Isely as an example), since some individuals may have been overlooked.

b.	Then go through correspondence related to expeditions (esp. Florida and California) as well as Natural History Survey and any work done with large institutions (esp. Smithsonian, Phil. Acad. Nat. Sci., and Bost. Acad. Sciences, as these have the most FIC’s and holes in their data).

Once the data is compiled into this sheet, it should be compared to the master malacology data. Some of this archival data may also be listed in publications found in the Bibliography spreadsheet. The goal of this step is to fill in as much data as possible, so be sure to fill in any collector names, dates, and verbatim species/locality info as possible. Three matches in data fields = a confirmed match, while two matched data fields should be matched with caution/are potential matches.

> Be sure to also compare synonymized taxonomy! Especially for older correspondence, taxonomy will be different.
