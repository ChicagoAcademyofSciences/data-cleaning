## Type specimen processing

### Objective
Ensure that all malacology type specimens are documented in Arctos. The process includes creating [identification citations](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/specimen-citations.html), printing updated [labels](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Create-Labels.html), and imaging specimens.

Workflow, written by NSF PEN collection technician [@dpiquard](https://github.com/orgs/ChicagoAcademyofSciences/people/dpiquard) in October 2018:
- Reference “Mala_Figured-Spec-and-Types” (L:/Inventory/Malacology/Mala Types Working) worksheet for bibliographic reference information of each type specimen. This file was created fom a combination of 2008-2012 inventory data and [bibliographic reference](bibliographic-references.markdown) research conducted by NSF PEN collection technician [@samhowes24](https://github.com/orgs/ChicagoAcademyofSciences/people/samuelhowes24).
  - When working with other collections, consult Director of Collections to create a similar discipline-specifric data capture spreadsheet to ensure systematic workflows. Type specimen catalogue numbers can be pulled directly from Arctos if data have been migrated, or can be found in discipline-specific inventory directories on CHAS internal servers.
  - If no bibliographic information is found for the specimen, use follow steps in [bibliographic reference workflows](bibliographic-references.markdown) to find citations for original taxonomic descriptions. For this, the [Biodiversity Heritage Library](biodiversitylibrary.org) is a great reference.
  - When type specimen citations are found, [search Arctos](https://arctos.database.museum/SpecimenUsage.cfm) to see if the article has been added as a publication. If not, [create a new publication](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Create-a-Publication.html) in Arctos.
- Link the specimen to the publication using [citations](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/specimen-citations.html) in specimen identifications.
  - When adding type status to a specimen record, choose the taxonomic name which appears in the citation (Ex. Pisidium danielsi was changed to Euglesa casertana, the original citation for Pisidium danielsi will be attached to the legacy ID and not the updated name).
  - This identification's [Nature of ID](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctnature_of_id) should be "type specimen." Add what category of Type Specimen (Holotype, Syntype, Lectotype, etc.) per the type status listed on the specimen label.
- Update “Malacology_Types_Working” (L:/Inventory/Malacology/Mala Types Working) spreadsheet with citation information. 
- Once all type specimens are updated in Arctos, print updated labels.
- Hand off specimens to specimen photography volunteers for imaging.
