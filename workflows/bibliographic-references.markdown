# Bibliographic References

The goal of this process was to connect CHAS specimens (particularly types) with historic published work that cites them. In some cases, this process also led to filling in collecting information that had previously been missing from the CHAS specimen inventory data. Research focused on journal articles and other published works that could potentially provide inventory lists, collecting information, or descriptions/figures of CHAS specimens. For more information on research into unpublished archival materials, please see our [Archives Research workflow document](archives-research.markdown).

For the CHAS malacology collection,
[@samuelhowes24](https://github.com/samuelhowes24) conducted the bibliographic references research described here.

Bibliographic references research for our entomology collection is in progress.

## Determining content focus

In order to most effectively target publications with a high likelihood of providing useful information, it was necessary to identify agents (collectors, donors, institutions) related to CHAS collections who may have authored relevant publications. To determine who should be researched as a potential author, the project technician aggregated and reconciled agent names, then calculated their frequency in CHAS inventory data. He used a cutoff of agents referenced in at least 25 inventory data rows to limit the scope of this process to our given timeframe and staff capacity.

## Determining content sources

The project technician identified the following sources for this bibliographic reference research:
- hard-copy CHAS publications
- online publications
- CHAS biographical files which list relevant publications
- existing CHAS bibliographies
- publications listed on Arctos


### Researching internal sources

Many of our best sources for CHAS collecting information had been made available in existing publications within our library. We used an existing library inventory to search different publications within our collection. Some of the Academy publications had not been made digitally available on our server, so it was necessary to look for digitized copies online through Google Books and BHL.

Where matches to CHAS specimens were found, the publication and page number was listed in the bibliography spreadsheet and the appropriate flag was used.

Some publications had images of specimens. When these images were of type specimens, they were compared with the originals in our collection to confirm their data. If confirmed, a note was made in the type specimen notes in the master malacology data.

### Researching online sources

Google Books and Biodiversity Heritage Library were our primary sources of digitized publications for this project. Several search terms were used, including author name, “Chicago Academy of Sciences”, and various species names.

Searches by author yielded a large number of publications that featured CAS specimens, such as the *Nautilus*, *Cincinnati Quarterly*, and *Proceedings* of various institutions.

In each publication, the species listed were compared with the data in the master malacology inventory spreadsheet. When a match was found in the data, or a specific specimen was listed as coming from CAS, the source was entered into the bibliography spreadsheet with the appropriate flag.

In some cases, there were photographs or illustrations of specimens. For our type specimens only, the photos were compared with the actual specimens in the collection to see if there was a match. Where there was a match, the figure was listed in the type specimen record.

## Prioritizing and tracking sources

Sources were tracked using an [Excel spreadsheet]() to capture information consistent with standard citations, i.e. author, date, title, publication, publisher, volume & issue, pages, and a DOI or URL link where possible. At a later date we will migrate these citations into Arctos so that we can better maintain a connection between specimens and historic publications that cite them. For the purposes of this grant we focused on the instances where publications enabled us to fill in missing collecting information, confirm type status, or otherwise augment the basic data associated with CHAS specimens.

The spreadsheet also contained columns for flags (see table below), which were assigned by the project technician to prioritize sources that may contain information we should integrate with CHAS specimen inventory data prior to publishing these data online.

| Flag | Flag indicates... |
| --- | --- |
| NF	| Not found in Academy Publications or Library Spreadsheet and unavailable online |
| T	| Item in CHAS collection, needs transcription |
| Done	| Source has been transcribed with OCR or available online AND compared to data in Malacology spreadsheet with relevant notes made in spreadsheet |
| CRF	| Item is transcribed or available online but needs to be cross referenced with Malacology datasets. Use INV if number of species is large |
| CRF-1	| CRF Source which has known information related to CHAS specimens. Keyword this source, including taxonomy |
| CRF-2	| CRF Source which possibly has information for CHAS specimens. Keyword only date range, collectors, and locality |
| CRF-3	| Source is tangentially related to CHAS collection, may or may not have some useful information. Key only the author, the year, and any general subject info |
| INV	| This source is transcribed and contains a large inventory or detailed list of specimens and can be immediately cross-referenced to the Malacology spreadsheet |
| INV-1	| INV Source which has known information related to CHAS specimens. Keyword ONLY date range, collectors, and locality |
| INV-2	| INV Source which possibly has information related to CHAS specimens. Keyword ONLY date range, collectors, and KNOWN, SPECIFIC localities (city or below) |
| ARCH	| This source is comprised of archival materials and should be combed for relevant data, see the [Archives workflow](archives-research.markdown) for more. |
| ARCH (Ready) | This source is comprised of archival materials which have been flagged and are ready for integration with inventory data, see the [Archives workflow](archives-research.markdown) for more. |

Using the flags above, INV-1 would be a potential wealth of information about many CHAS specimens, while CRF-3 may have information tangentially related to one or two CHAS specimens.

> At one of the later stages of the project, it was decided that keying publication records with search terms (author, taxa, location, etc.) would be useful. However, this was only done on several records because it involved a much deeper look into the listed publications. While the relevant contents of the keyed records can now easily be seen at a glance, this aspect of the project proved too much for our available time and staff capacity.

## Integrating relevant content

TBD.
