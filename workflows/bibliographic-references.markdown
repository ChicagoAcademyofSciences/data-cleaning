# Bibliographic References

The goal of this process was to establish a source of collecting information related to specimens referenced in publications. Collector, date, and locality were the primary targets of this project. Publications included in this research were **correspondence,** journals, and other published works which could potentially provide inventory lists or descriptions/images of CHAS specimens. For the purposes of data migration, publications were ranked by the possible relevance and quantity of information they could confirm or supplement. Post-data migration, we will work to record these publications on Arctos as time allows.

## Determining content focus

In order to most effectively target the publications with high potential, it was necessary to identify potential collectors and donors related to the CHAS malacology collection who may have authored relevant publications.

*As seen in the *Bibliography Spreadsheet_MAL 2017_03_04* Excel file in *L:\Inventory\Malacology\Bibliographical References*, there is a list of donors taken from the master Malacology Inventory data file, now available in the *L:\Inventory\Malacology\Data for Arctos (in progress)\Master Malacology Data* folder. Next to each name is the number of specimens that donor is associated with as well as several columns to track research into different types of publications.*

To establish the numbers of specimens per donor, [@samuelhowes24](https://github.com/samuelhowes24) aggregated and reconciled agent names, then counted their frequency in CHAS inventory data. Once the spreadsheet is set up, we decided that only individuals with more than 25 recorded specimens would be researched. This allowed for a more efficient comparison within a limited timeframe.

We identified six major sources of publications related to our specimens: hard-copy CHAS publications, CHAS biographical files which list relevant publications, existing CHAS bibliographies, digitized publications available on the Biodiversity Heritage Library website, digitized publications available on Google Books, and publications listed on Arctos. Archival materials were also looked through and will be detailed in Step 5. Each of these columns would be blank, “in process”, or “done” to denote whether an author had been compared to the source. Only BHL and Google Books were chosen as online sources because of their depth of available publications. Further online sources would have resulted in diminishing returns.

## Tracking progress

A set of flags was also established to quickly identify sources that would be useful in pre-migration processes. Initially a system of letters was used to denote whether the sources needed transcription and what data was included in the source (see flags T, CRF, NF, done, INV, and ARCH). It was later determined that a ranking system would be more useful, so the flags CRF and INV were used instead to denote the type of data provided in the source (single crossreference specimens or inventory of specimens) and the numbers 1-3 were used to establish relationship to existing inventory specimens. Thus, INV-1 would be a wealth of information about the collection, while CRF-3 may have information tangentially related to one or two of our specimens. ARCH flags were used for archival materials needing transcription.

We set up the bibliography spreadsheet with columns consistent with standard citation methods. Required information included: Author, date, title, journal/publication, publisher, volume and issue, pages, and a DOI/URL link. We also wanted columns for our flags, as well as keywords to make the sheet more searchable.

> At one of the later stages of the project, it was decided that keying records with search terms (author, taxa, location, etc.) would be useful. However, this was only done on several records because it involved a much deeper look into the listed publications. While the relevant contents of the keyed records can now easily be seen at a glance, this aspect of the project proved too time consuming for a single technician.

## Researching internal library records and Academy publications

Many of our best sources for CAS collecting information had been made available in existing publications within our library. We used an existing library inventory (L:\Inventory\Library\Academy publications) to search different publications within our collection. Some of the Academy publications had not been made digitally available on our server, so it was necessary to look for digitized copies online through Google Books and BHL.
- First, we searched each digitized source (or used the index/table of contents) to find relevant publications.
- Where matches to CAS specimens were found, the publication and page number was listed in the bibliography spreadsheet and the appropriate flag was used.
- Some publications had images of specimens. When these images were of type specimens, they were compared with the originals in our collection to confirm their data. If confirmed, a note was made in the type specimen notes in the master malacology data.

## Researching online sources

Google Books and BHL were our primary sources of digitized publications for this project. Several search terms were used, including author name, “Chicago Academy of Sciences”, and various species names.
- Searches by author yielded a large number of publications that featured CAS specimens, such as the *Nautilus*, *Cincinnati Quarterly*, and *Proceedings* of various institutions.
- In each publication, the species listed were compared with the data in the master malacology inventory spreadsheet. When a match was found in the data, or a specific specimen was listed as coming from CAS, the source was entered into the bibliography spreadsheet with the appropriate flag.
- In some cases, there were photographs or illustrations of specimens. For our type specimens only, the photos were compared with the actual specimens in the collection to see if there was a match. Where there was a match, the figure was listed in the type specimen record.

## Future work: Publications in Arctos
Publication entry into Arctos, however, proved much more successful. For each publication, an entry was made into the database:
- After opening Arctos, navigate to the Publication/Project page and click on “New Publication”
- Enter all requisite data, and then hit “Create publication”.
- A window may pop up listing similar publications and available DOIs. If one of those matches your entry, click on that record and move on.
- Every entry requires a DOI. If the listed publication does not have DOI, enter “could not find suitable DOI” in the remarks field.
