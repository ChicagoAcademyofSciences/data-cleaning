# Bibliographic References

The goal of this process was to connect CHAS specimens (particularly types) with historic published work that cites them. In some cases, this process also led to filling in collecting information that had previously been missing from the CHAS specimen inventory data. Research focused on journal articles and other published works that could potentially provide inventory lists, collecting information, or descriptions/figures of CHAS specimens. For more information on research into unpublished archival materials, please see our [archives workflow](archives-research.markdown).

For both the CHAS malacology and entomology collections,
[@samuelhowes24](https://github.com/samuelhowes24) conducted the bibliographic references research described here.

## Determining content focus

In order to most effectively target publications with a high likelihood of providing useful information, it was necessary to identify agents (collectors, donors, institutions) related to CHAS collections who may have authored relevant publications. To determine who should be researched as a potential author, the project technician aggregated and reconciled agent names, then calculated their frequency in CHAS inventory data. He used a cutoff of agents referenced in at least 25 inventory data rows to limit the scope of this process to our given timeframe and staff capacity.

See [here](../working-files/Mala_Bibliography-Agents_2017-03-04.xlsx) for malacology collection agents.

See [here](../working-files/Ento_Bibliography-Agents_2017-02-08.xlsx) for entomology collection agents.

## Determining content sources

The project technician identified the following sources for this bibliographic reference research:
- CHAS publications
- CHAS biographical files
- Online search portals ([Biodiversity Heritage Library](http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org), [Google Books](https://books.google.com), [Arctos](http://arctos.database.museum/SpecimenUsage.cfm))

## Prioritizing and tracking sources

Sources were tracked using Excel spreadsheets for both  [malacology](../working-files/Mala_Bibliography-Publications_2017-03-04.xlsx) and [entomology](../working-files/Ento_Bibliography-Publications_2017-02-08.xlsx) to capture information consistent with standard citations, i.e. author, date, title, publication, publisher, volume & issue, pages, and a DOI or URL link where possible. **At a later date we will migrate these publications into Arctos** so that we can better maintain a connection between historic citations and specimen records. For the purposes of this grant, however, we focused on the instances where publications enabled us to fill in missing collecting information, confirm type status, or otherwise augment basic data associated with CHAS specimens.

The spreadsheet also contained a column for flags (see table below), which were assigned by the project technician to prioritize sources that may contain information we should integrate with CHAS specimen inventory data prior to publishing these data online. For example,
according to the flags below, INV-1 would be a potential wealth of information about many CHAS specimens, while CRF-3 may have information tangentially related to one or two CHAS specimens.

| Flag | Flag indicates... |
| --- | --- |
| NF	| Citation found but full publication is not available either online or in hard-copy at CHAS. |
| Done	| Publication has been cross-referenced with inventory master data. |
| CRF-1	| Publication is available in digital or print format but still needs to be cross referenced with inventory master data. Source is related to CHAS collection and likely has significant useful information. |
| CRF-2	| Publication is available in digital or print format but still needs to be cross referenced with inventory master data. Source is related to CHAS collection and likely has some useful information. |
| CRF-3	| Publication is available in digital or print format but still needs to be cross referenced with inventory master data. Source is tangentially related to CHAS collection, and may or may not have useful information. |
| INV-1	| Publication is an inventory or detailed specimen list, available in digital or print format but still needs to be cross referenced with inventory master data. Source is related to CHAS collection and likely has significant useful information. |
| INV-2	| Publication is an inventory or detailed specimen list, available in digital or print format but still needs to be cross referenced with inventory master data. Source is related to CHAS collection and likely has some useful information. |
| ARCH	| Source is comprised of archival materials that should be combed for relevant data, see the [archives workflow](archives-research.markdown) for more. |

## Researching CHAS sources

CHAS has inventoried, and in many cases digitized, the publications it produced internally. This includes scientific series such as *The Bulletin of the Chicago Academy of Sciences* as well as series for general membership, e.g. *Museum Activites*. Publications that have been scanned and OCR-ed are available online via [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/chicagoacademyofsciences). The project technician searched for the agents identified above in the CHAS internal publication inventories. Where a relevant publication was found, he made an entry in the spreadsheet, flagged it according to the codes above, and tracked down the most accessible source: an in-house digital version, a digital version from an external provider, or a hard-copy available at CHAS.

Biographical files have been created for a number of notable people asociated with CHAS, and where the person has published work the biography typically includes a bibliography. For the agents identified above, the project technician reviewed any existing CHAS biographical files.

Where publications had images of a type specimen, the images or catalog numbers were compared with the specimens at CHAS to confirm the connection. When confirmed, a note was made in the *Type specimen notes* column of the master inventory data, which was used to migrate citations into Arctos. Otherwise, the publication was only reviewed enough to assign a flag, and recorded in the bibliography spreadsheet for future cross-referencing.

## Researching online sources

After researching CHAS internal publications, the project technician searched for the agents identified above in the [Biodiversity Heritage Library](http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org), in [Google Books](https://books.google.com), and in [Arctos publications](http://arctos.database.museum/SpecimenUsage.cfm). These sources were chosen because Biodiversity Heritage Library is the preeminent source for digitized natural history literature, Google Books has a very wide base to search from, and Arctos is where our citations will eventually be tracked.

In addition to searching by the agent names on these online sources, the project technician also searched for publications using terms
"Chicago Academy of Sciences" plus various species names.

Where publications had images of a type specimen, the images or catalog numbers were compared with the specimens at CHAS to confirm the connection. When confirmed, a note was made in the *Type specimen notes* column of the master inventory data, which was used to migrate citations into Arctos. Otherwise, the publication was only reviewed enough to assign a flag, and recorded in the bibliography spreadsheet for future cross-referencing.

## Integrating relevant content

Cross-referencing the bibliographic references produced by this research is still in progress for both malacology and entomology collections. Future priorities should include creating citations for those publications flagged as CRF-1 and INV-1.
