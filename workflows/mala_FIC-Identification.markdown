# FIC Identification (malacology)
## For identifying FIC records by cross-referencing data between Arctos, catalog data, and cleaned catalog/accessions data

The goal of this project is to identify FIC'd specimens with existing records not already associated with a specimen. The inventory, accession, and some catalog data used in this project have already been cleaned and cross-referenced with each other and Arctos. Thus, the majority of this project will be matching up duplicate records between FICs and the unmatched catalog records.

### Background Information

The original spreadsheet used for this project was the _________________spreadsheet on the museum's L server. Any previous work done before this project starts, such as Accession and Catalog Matching and what data was imported from where.
