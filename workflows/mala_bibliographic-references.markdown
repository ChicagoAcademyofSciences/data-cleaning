# Bibliographic References (malacology)

*Need to flesh out collecting information for specimens referenced in publications, especially published inventory lists. Secondary project (not essential for grant) to record references and publications in Arctos. Target high potential publications pre-migration and the rest post, as time allows.

Primary goal of project was to establish a source of collecting information related to specimens referenced in publications. Collector, date, and locality are the primary targets of this project. Appropriate publications include journals, correspondence, and other published works which potentially provide inventory lists or descriptions/images of type specimens. Publications will be ranked by potential for use in the pre-migration stages of the PEN grant. The secondary goal of the project is to record these publications and references on Arctos as time allows.

## Step 1: Preparation work
In order to most effectively target the publications with high potential, it was necessary to identify potential authors and collectors related to our malacology collection. As seen in the *Bibliography Spreadsheet_MAL 2017_03_04* Excel file in *L:\Inventory\Malacology\Bibliographical References*, there is a list of donors taken from the master Malacology Inventory data file, now available in the *L:\Inventory\Malacology\Data for Arctos (in progress)\Master Malacology Data* folder. Next to each name is the number of specimens that donor is associated with as well as several columns to track research into different types of publications.

### To establish the numbers of specimens per donor:
- Sort the master data by Received from-Arctos and copy those names to a column in a new Excel sheet. Save the new sheet as “Donor List from Spreadsheet”
- Use the =COUNTIF function to get the number of times each donor name appears in the master data. (Needs more detail)
- Reconcile each name and combine totals where needed. E.g. if “Frank Collins Baker” has 300 entires, and “F.C. Baker” has 50 entries, the “F.C. Baker” record should be added to the “Frank Collins Baker” total so that there is one record which reads “Frank Collins Baker” with 350 associated specimens.

### To establish a means of tracking progress and quality of sources:
- We identified six major sources of publications related to our specimens: existing CAS publications in our library/server, CAS biographical files which list relevant publications, existing CAS bibliographies, digitized publications available on the Biodiversity Heritage Library website, digitized publications available on Google Books, and publications listed on Arctos. Archival materials were also looked through and will be detailed in Step 5. Each of these columns would be blank, “in process”, or “done” to denote whether an author had been compared to the source.
- A set of flags was also established to quickly identify sources that would be useful in pre-migration processes. Initially a system of letters was used to denote whether the sources needed transcription and what data was included in the source (see flags T, CRF, NF, done, INV, and ARCH). It was later determined that a ranking system would be more useful, so the flags CRF and INV were used instead to denote the type of data provided in the source (single crossreference specimens or inventory of specimens) and the numbers 1-3 were used to establish relationship to existing inventory specimens. Thus, INV-1 would be a wealth of information about the collection, while CRF-3 may have information tangentially related to one or two of our specimens. ARCH flags were used for archival materials needing transcription.
- We set up the bibliography spreadsheet with columns consistent with standard citation methods. Required information included: Author, date, title, journal/publication, publisher, volume and issue, pages, and a DOI/URL link. We also wanted columns for our flags, as well as keywords to make the sheet more searchable.

## Step 2: Deciding on authors/publications
Once the spreadsheet is set up, we decided that only individuals with more than 25 recorded specimens will be researched. This allowed for a more efficient comparison within a limited timeframe. In addition, only BHL and Google Books were chosen as online sources because of their depth of available publications. Further online sources would have resulted in diminishing returns.

## Step 3: Initial research- Existing library records and Academy publications
Many of our best sources for CAS collecting information had been made available in existing publications within our library. We used an existing library inventory (L:\Inventory\Library\Academy publications) to search different publications within our collection. Some of the Academy publications had not been made digitally available on our server, so it was necessary to look for digitized copies online through Google Books and BHL. 
- First, we searched each digitized source (or used the index/table of contents) to find relevant publications.
- Where matches to CAS specimens were found, the publication and page number was listed in the bibliography spreadsheet and the appropriate flag was used.
- Some publications had images of specimens. When these images were of type specimens, they were compared with the originals in our collection to confirm their data. If confirmed, a note was made in the type specimen notes in the master malacology data.

## Step 4: Online Sources
Google Books and BHL were our primary sources of digitized publications for this project. Several search terms were used, including author name, “Chicago Academy of Sciences”, and various species names.
- Searches by author yielded a large number of publications that featured CAS specimens, such as the Nautilus, Cincinnati Quarterly, and Proceedings of various institutions. 
- In each publication, the species listed were compared with the data in the master malacology inventory spreadsheet. When a match was found in the data, or a specific specimen was listed as coming from CAS, the source was entered into the bibliography spreadsheet with the appropriate flag.
- In some cases, there were photographs of specimens. For our type specimens only, the photos were compared with the actual specimens in the collection to see if there was a match. Where there was a match, the figure was listed in the type specimen record.

## Step 5: Archival Records
Many of our malacology specimens had no available published information. However, we did have archival records associated with several individuals, e.g. Frank Collins Baker, Jose Quadras, and Elizabeth Emerson Atwater. Given the organizational state of some of the archival records, it was also deemed necessary to set up a filing system to ensure easier access.
- The first step of this sub-project was to ensure that the archival material was staged properly. Many of the folders were organized by corespondee, and could be listed by individual name or associated agency. Where possible, the latter was adopted to ensure easier sorting. Separate folders were made for each individual or agency, while pieces of white archival paper were used to separate related sets of correspondence within each folder.
- These records were not digitized, so it was necessary to go through them by hand. Latex gloves were used to minimize damage to the paper. A quick visual scan of each letter was completed, and the reader was looking specifically for references to taxa and collecting locations as well as titles for publications. Relevant records were flagged with a red Post-It note on the outside of the appropriate file folder.
- In a few cases, such as the Quadras records, a detailed inventory of donated specimens was found. These records were kept in their original filing and the folders were flagged with a red Post-It.
- Wherever relevant data was found, a record was made in the bibliography spreadsheet detailing the Archival Box number (where applicable) and primary author of the correspondence. Appropriate bibliography flags were then used.

## Step 6: Keying records and entering into Arctos
At one of the later stages of the project, it was decided that keying records with search terms (author, taxa, location, etc.) would be useful. However, this was only done on several records because it involved a much deeper look into the listed publications. While the relevant contents of the keyed records can now easily be seen at a glance, this aspect of the project proved too time consuming for a single technician.
Publication entry into Arctos, however, proved much more successful. For each publication, an entry was made into the database:
- After opening Arctos, navigate to the Publication/Project page and click on “New Publication”
- Enter all requisite data, and then hit “Create publication”.
- A window may pop up listing similar publications and available DOIs. If one of those matches your entry, click on that record and move on.
- Every entry requires a DOI. If the listed publication does not have DOI, enter “could not find suitable DOI” in the remarks field.
