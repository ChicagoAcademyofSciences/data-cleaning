## Validating Entomology Inventory Data

1.	Use the spreadsheet to find specimen locations, create a list of all needed drawers and how many specimens there are in each drawer
2.	Give each drawer its own color in the spreadsheet to make finding specimens easier
3.	Bring down one drawer at a time and start to find the specimens in the spreadsheet
4.	Make sure the data in the spreadsheet corresponds with the data on each specimen’s label
5.	Note the condition of the specimen in the spreadsheet
6.	Check to see if the listed taxonomic info is correct and still current, if not, update it
7.	Once the data is all correct, type out the label in the template
8.	Continue checking data and typing labels for each specimen until the label sheet is full
9.	Print the labels on cardstock and pin them beneath each specimen
10.	Once each specimen in the drawer has been addressed, check the spreadsheet to make sure there are no entries that weren’t found in the drawer and vice versa
11.	If specimens were found in the drawer that weren’t listed as in that drawer in the spreadsheet, search the entire spreadsheet for those specimens
12.	If they are found elsewhere in the spreadsheet, change their location to correspond with the current drawer
13.	If they are not found in the spreadsheet, create a new entry, entering all pertinent data from the specimen’s labels
14.	If specimens were listed in the spreadsheet as being in the current drawer but were not found, flag them in the spreadsheet so they can be searched for in other drawers
15.	Repeat process for each drawer
16.	If the missing specimens weren’t found in any drawer, note that they are missing in the spreadsheet
17.	Once all specimens are labeled and accounted for, organize specimens by family, grouping the most related specimens with each other
18.	Ensure the specimens are spaced apart sufficiently
19.	Create family labels for each box
20.	Once specimens are in their final locations, update the storage location and updated by fields in the spreadsheet
